## Project Inspiration
Breath of the Wild is one of my favorite games of all time. While the original goal was to implement a fireball, I shifted the design to a falling star fragment. Here is a picture of the star fragment from the game for context: </br>

## Extra Spice!
- I modeled a Breath of the Wild-inspired star fragment using Pentaki's Dodecahedron preset in Blender. I made an **OBJ import** to my project. I needed to create a new geometry class that would parse my OBJ based on its file path. Then, I replaced my placeholder icosphere with my new star fragment model, and applied the vertex and fragment shaders to my new shape. </br>
- I added a simple navy background with noise. </br>
